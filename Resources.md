# Resources

I've pulled lecture materials from a variety of sources, but below is a collection that I've found particularly useful or interesting.

This list is non-exhaustive, and I'll be adding to it periodically as the lectures progress.

## General quantum computing
- [Introduction to Quantum Information and Computation (Nielsen and Chuang)](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UDDSOP619RB&keywords=quantum+computation+and+quantum+information&qid=1557595705&s=gateway&sprefix=quantum+computation+%2Caps%2C311&sr=8-1); basically the quantum computing 'bible'
- [Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) (by Nielsen from Nielsen and Chuang)
- [Learning Quantum Computing with Python and Q#](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-quantum-computing-with-python-and-q-sharp) (early access link to a new textbook, being written by some of my collaborators)
- [Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computing-Introduction-Eleanor-Rieffel/dp/0262526670); haven't looked through it myself, but have heard good things from friends
- [Adiabatic Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04471)
- [Some lecture notes on projective measurements and teleportation](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~sgharibian/courses/CMSC491/notes/Lecture%203%20-%20Measurement.pdf)

## Hardware
- [Quantum computing report](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/), a webpage that keeps track of major companies and startups and their hardware progress
- [An outlook on superconducting circuits.]([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1169.full)
- [A Youtube playlist by D-Wave about quantum annealing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPvKnT7dgEsvVQwGgrlUVXBa2J6PAW8a4) 
- [Experimental Comparison of Two Quantum Computing Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01852) (discusses superconducting qubits and trapped ions)
- [Quantum computing with neutral atoms](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3626)
- [Quantum computing with atomic qubits and Rydberg interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05207)
- [A Quantum Engineer's Guide to Superconducting Qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560) (a bit too technical for me, but maybe suitable for people with a more hardware experience)


## Algorithms and applications
- [A NASA Perspective on Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04836), mostly about quantum annealing but gives some nice applications and a technical discussion of hardware
- [A list of problems that are QMA-complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6312), i.e. hard even for quantum computers
- [Ground-state energy estimation of the water molecule on a trapped ion quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10171)
- [Quantum Computational Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10402), a very clear and methodical overview of the field
- [Ising formulation of many NP problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)

## Software
- [IBM Qiskit documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)
- [Rigetti's Forest SDK](https://www.rigetti.com/forest)
- [D-Wave Ocean overview](https://ocean.dwavesys.com/)
- [Google's Cirq Python library](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq)
- [Overview of software by Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/software/) (it's Beatles themed!)
- [Microsoft's Q# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/?view=qsharp-preview)
- [Q++](https://github.com/vsoftco/qpp) (a quantum simulator written by ones of my collaborators at Waterloo)
- [OpenFermion](https://github.com/quantumlib/openfermion) (Python libraries for simulation of Fermionic systems, quite intuitive to use)
