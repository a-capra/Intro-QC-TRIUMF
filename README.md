# Intro-QC-TRIUMF
Lecture slides and notebooks for my first lecture series at TRIUMF, "An introduction to quantum computing and quantum annealing".

To run the notebooks, you'll need:
 - Python 3 (Anaconda is best; if not, you'll need numpy and networkx)
 - IBM's [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/terra)
 - D-Wave's [Ocean SDK](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/install.html)
 
Feel free to re-use these materials however you like, and let me know if you find any errors!
