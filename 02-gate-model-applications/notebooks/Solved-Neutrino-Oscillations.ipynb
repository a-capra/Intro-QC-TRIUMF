    "This notebook is meant to get you started towards implementing the neutrino oscillation procedure detailed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10559. The paper shows the details for both 2- and 3-flavour oscillations, but we'll focus here on just two, $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$. Specifically, we will work on reproducing Figure 2, where we will plot the 'survival' probability of the electron neutrino."
